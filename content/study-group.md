The study group is a really casual meeting, similar to an unconference. You
donâ€™t need to have experience with Go or public speaking. All you need is
a bit of programming experience and an interest to learn about or demonstrate
cool stuff related to Go.

The study group is a great way to not only _lurk 'n learn_ Go, but meet other people in the
community! Everyone is welcome regardless of background or experience with Go!

"Go Study Group - India" is an offshoot of the "Go Study Group" with an aim to engage gophers in India. It is open to everyone around the world. All communication takes place in English. The `India` session does not overlap with the `Go Study Group` USA session, so, you can participate in both!

Go Study Group - India is independently managed and run by volunteers in India.
The agenda, proposals, and discussions are all managed on the GolangIndia [StudyGroup](https://github.com/golangindia/StudyGroup/) repo on Github. You'll also find the latest updates in the README.

Videos from our past sessions are available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ3tfDfrAZYtuIclbgETFyQ).

Join the **#gostudygroup-india** channel on [Gophers slack](/community/#chat) to hangout with the community.
